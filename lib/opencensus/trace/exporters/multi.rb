      # The Multi exporter multiplexes captured spans to a set of delegate
      # exporters. It is useful if you need to export to more than one
      # destination. You may also use it as a "null" exporter by providing
      # no delegates.
      #
      # Multi delegates to an array of the exporter objects. You can manage
      # the list of exporters using any method of Array. For example:
      #
      #     multi = OpenCensus::Trace::Exporters::Multi.new
      #     multi.export(spans)  # Does nothing
      #     multi << OpenCensus::Trace::Exporters::Logger.new
      #     multi.export(spans)  # Exports to the logger
      #
      class Multi < SimpleDelegator
        ##
        # Create a new Multi exporter
        #
        # @param [Array<#export>] delegates An array of exporters
        #
        def initialize *delegates
          super(delegates.flatten)
        end

        ##
        # Pass the captured spans to the delegates.
        #
        # @param [Array<Span>] spans The captured spans.
        #
        def export spans
          each { |delegate| delegate.export spans }
          nil
